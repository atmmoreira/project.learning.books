## Block-level Elements

By default, block-level elements generate an element box that (by default) fills its parent element's content area and cannot have other elements at its sides. In other words, its generates "breaks" before and after the element box. The most familiar block elements from HTML are < p > and < div >.

## Inline-level Elements

By default, inline-level element generates an element box within a line of text do not break up thr flow of that line. The best inline element example is the < a >. Others candidates are < strong > an < em >. These elements do not generate a "break" before or after themselves, so they can appear within the content of another element without disrupting its display.
